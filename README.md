# CrimeCompetition

This repository contains the original data files, the consolidated master.csv and master2.csv files which are used in the models, and the ipynb files that contain the code for the models. Each model should be in its own python file. The scrap folder is code we used early on and didn't use in our final report and official results for these data.
